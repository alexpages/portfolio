# portfolio
This is my personal website.


## Project Description

The main purpose is to create a personal portfolio. It was undertaken with the intention to get familiarized with the following:
- HTML, CSS and Javascript
- Google Developer tools and how to debug
- Experience with root variables for enabling light/dark mode
- Add media queries to enhance user experience.

## How to Install and Run the Project
To run this project I used Visual Studio Code and Go Live function. To run it the same way as I did make sure to have all files in the same folder directory and open it with Visual Studio Code. Finally, use Go Live function

## How to use the project
There is no specific use rather than being a portfolio as it is. The website is a never ending project, therefore, expect it to be modified through time. 

## Future possible enhancements
  - Improve network loading time by reducing images size.
  - Improve network security adding "no referer" or similar to anchors in html. 
  - Update Projects section in portfolio with more actual ones.
