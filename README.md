This is my personal website.


## Things I have worked with:

1. Overall HTML and CSS configuration for a simple but direct website.

2. Added media query for responsive design.

3. Added JQuery to add some motion to the website.

## Note:
- The website is a never ending project, therefore, expect to be modified through time. 
- If you think you can help me by commenting or by suggesting any enhancement, feel free to do so :).
